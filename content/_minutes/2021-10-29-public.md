## Propositions and motions

### Update on bank account

Instruments of authorisation required for further bank contact were issued,
their exact detail have been redacted for containing personally identifiable
information and commercially sensitive information.

### Data retention

A working group was formed to revisit and evaluate our current data retention
policy as it pertains to data used for abuse mitigation in particular, and
tasked with making a proposal if they find changes are necessary.

### Preparations for chair elections

Discussions that were started on the
[August 2021 MGM](/minutes/2021-08-27-mgm-minutes#preparations-for-chair-elections)
around key qualities for our organisation chair continued, a working group was
formed to summarise these discussions and make preparations for the upcoming
election.

## Other questions

### Consensus-based decision making training

After having taken training on consensus-based decision making, an open
discussions around how we apply this in our organisation was held, the working
group on summarising the qualities in a chair took this as additional input on
what our chair should be able to facilitate.

### Names on the website

As a follow up on the discussion from the
[August 2021 MGM](/minutes/2021-08-27-mgm-minutes#transparency---real-names-on-the-website),
having considered the feedback from group contacts, a decision to stop listing
realnames on our website was made, this will be implemented in a future date.

### Minutes storage

Discussions around how and where our signed minutes are currently stored and
if the ergonomics of accessing and searching through them could be improved.

### `+w` by default

We will be turning on wallops (`+w`) by default as an experiment, more on this
will be published separately.
